 * Puts a composer's message away before the composer goes.
 *
 * Whatever is unsaved is written first; the row is then pushed so its server
 * copy does not wait out the push debounce. The answer says whether the
 * composer may now go: a message that could not be written must stay on
 * screen, because closing over a failed save is the one way a composer loses
 * what somebody typed. A message that never held anything has no row and
 * nothing to push, and may go at once.
 *
 * Shared by the popped-out window's close, by the account switch in the
 * main window, which has to file the draft under the account it was written
 * in before the store's notion of "active" moves, and by leaving Drafts for
 * another mailbox, which used to leave the editor floating over the inbox.
