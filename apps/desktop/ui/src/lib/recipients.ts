 * separator.
 *
 * A line break separates too. A column of addresses copied from a spreadsheet
 * or another client arrives one per line, and Apple Mail, Gmail and
 * Thunderbird all make a recipient of each line. Here the three became one
 * red chip, and Send refused it as a single address.
 *
 * A comma inside double quotes is part of a name: pasting
 * `"Wu, Dana" <dana@example.com>` used to make two chips, one of them an
 * address of `"Wu`, and the send was refused for it. Nothing inside `<…>`
 * splits either, since that is the address itself. A quote or a `<` protects
 * only when it closes, and a `<` closes at the next `>`, before any other
 * `<`: one typed and never closed swallowed every recipient after it into a
 * single red chip. The send path splits by the same rule (`split_recipients`
 * in send.rs), so the chips on screen are the recipients on the envelope.
